# AngularPokeapi

This is an Angular practice project app with the purpose of learning Angular that is used at my internship place.

By using PokeAPIv2, this app will be able to :

1. Show Pokemon list
2. Search Pokemon
3. Add & Remove Pokemon from My Pokemons
4. TBA

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.8. For the styling, I use TailwindCSS v2.2.16.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
